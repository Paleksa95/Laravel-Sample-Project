# Laravel-Sample-Project

Hello , this is my first project made in Laravel framework.

I tried to incorporate a lot of stuff in it like:

Modification of Laravel auth ( custom ACL ),CRUD,Only admin can edit users and give them roles,message approval by moderator,pagination,
policies usage,e-mail verification,differen type of relations,different type of users,users can do different stuff based on their role and 
message count.. and much more...

In future i am planing to add few other options like: Only user can update/edit his own message/thread, moderator can add update/edit any
message/thread,Maybe I will add more different roles. ( DONE )

In next update , i will add search option , make front end better and add profile pictures.
